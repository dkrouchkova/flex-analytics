			<p> As one of my last projects, I think it's fitting to tell you what I've learned over the past four years. There have been many classes, countless readings, papers and projects, but the most important things I've learned came from beyond computer screens and highlighted packets.</p>

			<h2>Be Human</h2>
			<p>Look people in the eye and realize we’re all human. We each have our own fears and preoccupations, responsibilities (some of which we’re trying to avoid) and dreams. No one gets what they deserve in life. But nobody deserves to be ignored. Smile a bit more, make eye contact and maybe strike up a conversation. It doesn’t take that much time and it feels good. </p>
			<p>Being shitty to people is petty. Have a little bit of empathy and maybe you can make someone’s day just a tiny bit better. Wouldn’t you want someone to do that for you as well? I’m not preaching for you to become a servant to your fellow man, or get in everyone’s business for the sake of “helping”. If that’s what you feel it takes, sure, go for it. But building a human connection with someone can take as little as acknowledgement that they are more than their job, or looks, or accent. </p>

			<h2>Love yo'self</h2>
			<p>It’s a cliché, I know, but it’s the most important thing you can do. What I always struggled with was what that phrase actually means. Do I need to love how I look all the time? Or never reject any idea I have? Or always be happy? It seems like an impossible feat, or one that would take superhuman strength at the least. But I’ve found it’s a bit easier. </p>
			<p>I think loving yourself means finding the little things that bring you joy. It may be making breakfast for yourself in the morning, or passing through a place off the beaten path along the daily commute, or even picking your nose after a long day. It’s also learning to be comfortable when you’re alone with your thoughts. Being able to have an internal dialogue where you can be honest as hell with yourself is essential. Worries, hopes, criticisms, ideas need to be processed. Pick them apart; reflect upon who you are and who you want to be. Instead of hating yourself for not being what or where you thought you should be doesn’t do anyone any good, especially you. Instead think of how you can be better for you.</p>
			<p>Being better for yourself means you’re open to what opportunities (and crap) come your way and having the trust to know which ones you grab like a white girl grabs a free Starbucks, and which ones you turn down. It also means you’re going to start making changes for the sake of you. No more “maybe’s” and “tomorrow’s”. </p>
			<p>If I’m not convincing you, maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0" target="_blank">Shia LaBeouf</a> can.</p>

			<h2>Keep Learning</h2>
			<p>Take a class on something you’ve always wanted to do. Or just watch some YouTube videos on how to do it. Or read a book. Anything at all. Just don’t forget that your brain needs some love. Go beyond the headlines or the “experts say”. Who are these experts? What the hell do they know? Dig a little deeper. </p>
			<p>Contemplate the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrU9YDoXE88" target="_blank">infinite</a> or the <a href="http://htwins.net/scale2/" target="_blank">minuscule</a>. Let your mind wander and don’t be afraid to look behind dark corners or under rocks. The most terrifying thing you’ll be faced with is the unknown. Embrace it. Come up with your own questions and search for answers. You might stumble upon something remarkable. </p>
